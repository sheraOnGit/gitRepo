GIT operations and commands

Creating Repositories:

Create link with central repository:
git remote add origin "<remote link>"

Commit changes.
git commit -m "<message for commit>"

command on branches
types of branches:
Local Branches
Remote tracking branches

to create new branch
git branch "branchname" 

to switch to another branch
git checkout branchname

merge to master branch
first switch to master branch
git merge <brachName>
 
if we make change and commit file in a branch it's modification is not seen in another branch until unless we merge that branch to another branche.

When we create branch on any parent branch , then child branch copy all the (commited)file in parent branch at that intstant.
But after creating child branch on parent branch , if any modification done in parent branch it is not reflected in child branch.We have to merge parent branch to child branch then.

Rebaising 
checkout to branch in which we have to merge
git rebase <name of branch name to merge>

go to github account->setting ->ssh and gpg keys->new ssh key and paste the key
